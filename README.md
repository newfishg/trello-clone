# Trello Clone App

This is my implementation of the Trello. It's not intended as a complete replication of the App. It's purpose is for studying of JavaScript, jQuery and Backbone


If you want to try it, run
`bower install` and `npm install` to install all dependencies and start the page by `npm start`

The page link is localhost:3000
